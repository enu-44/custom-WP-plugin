Drag and drop - can also be done with different options and then make sense of it by dragging right? Or, for example, give 6 words, then a written paragraph in which they can drag the 6 words to the right place.

Check which words mean the same thing - This one will be slightly different, synonyms is difficult at a low level. This will contain a sentence and then they can tick from options 1 what that means / the correct answer is.

Spelling test - reader uses the microphone to speak a piece of text. This would only be from the high level, and it is possible to add "skip" after that if the microphone doesn't work, or they don't want to. Can imagine that not everyone is waiting for that. And it must be the case that you can still complete the test, not that it gets stuck on it.

Type what is said in the audio - possibly also an option to "skip" if the person cannot hear the text, due to an error in the audio.

Those types are possible right?
